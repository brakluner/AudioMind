# AudioMind

AudioMind Is a creative thinkspace which allows artists to upload custom tracks of music and create playlists. With the integration of Spotify, users can conveniently update their playlists and find inspiration for their own creative works. 

Registered users will find this app to be a useful platform for collaborating on works by providing a platform for sharing tracks between users and providing the user with an outlet for communication. Collaberations include a chat area and a contributers tab including users who added to the project. In order to combat online piracy, uploaded content will be limited by copywrite.
